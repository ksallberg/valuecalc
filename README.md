valuecalc
=========

Value based (haskell powered) investment calculations for the Nasdaq market.

Usage:
modify main function of ValueCalc.hs to include the list of tickers you are interested in. Then "runhaskell ValueCalc.hs" in a terminal.

How:
For each ticker, this program calculates the balance sheet value of the company and compares it with the market cap to determine if the company is undervalued. A positive difference value shows how much undervalued the company is. A negative shows how overvalued it is. I'm not responsible in any way if your investments turn out to be bad!
